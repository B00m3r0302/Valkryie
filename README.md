## Description:

*This is the command line version of GuardianAngel and will be included with the full release of GuardianAngel which includes a full UI*

An automated incident detection and response system for use on autonomous vehicles with limited connectivity. This is a compiled executable that will run in the background on a base operating system of Windows to monitor for attacks across the spectrum of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Specific features that are currently supported can be found in the Implemented.md file in the Planning/ directory. At this time the tool can simply detect these attacks and automated response is slowly being added to the capability suite.
